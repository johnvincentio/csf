Imagine you are looking for a book in a library with a Dewey Decimal index.

How would you go about it?

Can you express this process as a searching algorithm?
*/

/*

Ask the librarian!
Search library online catalog.

/*

It has been a long time since I last looked up a book in a library.

Maybe something like this.

Review Dewey Deciml Classification Categories.
Determine the category and category number of the book.

I believe there is:
	an index by author name and 
	an index by book name.

Don't remember whether these indices were by Category.

With the category, look up the book name index or the author name index.
